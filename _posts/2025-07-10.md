## The Network Tool I Never Thought I’d Build (Until I Did)
When I first saw the project title “Implementing a Network Developer Tool in Servo,” I was intrigued—but also a bit confused. What even is an embeddable browser? What’s a network developer tool?
As someone with a background in backend development—building APIs and working closely with databases—I rarely gave much thought to what happens inside the browser after it makes a request. To me, the browser was just a passive client that sent requests and showed responses. Working on Servo has changed that. It broadened my understanding and helped me see the browser as an active, complex engine—an essential part of the full-stack web development story.
