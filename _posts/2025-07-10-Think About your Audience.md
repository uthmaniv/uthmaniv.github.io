## The Network Tool I Never Thought I’d Build (Until I Did)
When I first saw the project title “Implementing a Network Developer Tool in Servo,” I was intrigued—but also a bit confused. What even is an embeddable browser? What’s a network developer tool?
As someone with a background in backend development—building APIs and working closely with databases—I rarely gave much thought to what happens inside the browser after it makes a request. To me, the browser was just a passive client that sent requests and showed responses. Working on Servo has changed that. It broadened my understanding and helped me see the browser as an active, complex engine—an essential part of the full-stack web development story.

## So... What Is Servo?
Servo is a modern, experimental browser engine originally developed by Mozilla and now maintained by the community. It’s written in Rust and aims to rethink browser architecture with parallelism, performance, and safety in mind.
Unlike Firefox or Chrome, Servo isn’t a full browser on its own—it’s designed to be embeddable, meaning it can be plugged into other applications. Those external apps, called embedders, provide the user interface and handle interactions. Meanwhile, Servo handles the heavy lifting of fetching resources, parsing HTML/CSS, and rendering web content.
Think of Servo as the engine of a car, and the embedder as the dashboard and controls. The two communicate through an embedder API, working together to provide a smooth ride—er, browsing experience.


What is a Network Developer Tool?
Before this project, I had used the Network tab in Chrome or Firefox DevTools without thinking too much about it. It was just... there. I’d open it to see if a request failed or took too long. But now, I understand just how vital it is—and how complex it is to build.
A network developer tool allows developers to monitor every network request the browser makes when loading a webpage. This includes images, fonts, stylesheets, JavaScript files, and API calls. For each request, developers can inspect:
•	The URL and method (GET, POST, etc.)
•	The status code (200, 404, etc.)
•	The request/response headers and payloads
•	Performance data like how long it took to respond
This tool is essential for debugging, performance analysis, and understanding how web pages behave under the hood. Unfortunately, Servo didn’t have this tool—until now.
My Contribution: Building the Network Panel in Servo
My Outreachy project is focused on implementing the missing Network Panel in Servo’s DevTools. The goal is to capture and display all the network activity happening inside Servo when a web page loads.
This involves two main components:
1.	Capturing network events from Servo's core engine – extracting key data like URLs, status codes, and timing information.
2.	Sending and displaying those events in the DevTools frontend – turning that raw data into something developers can see and interact with.
My work spans both backend and frontend layers: hooking into the internal request lifecycle, formatting structured messages, transmitting them through Servo’s devtools protocol, and updating the user interface to reflect real-time network activity.




## Challenges and Insights
One of the biggest challenges was navigating Servo’s large codebase as a newcomer. Terms like “pipeline,” “resource channel,” and “actor” were everywhere, and it took time to understand what they meant and how they fit together.
I quickly learned to start small. My first win came from tracking down where network requests are initiated and figuring out how to capture just one event. That gave me the confidence to trace more complex flows.
Another challenge was designing the communication between the engine and the DevTools. I had to ensure that events were sent at the right time, in the right format, and didn’t break anything else in the process. Timing and precision mattered more than I expected.
But the most rewarding insight has been this: I’m not just writing code. I’m building a tool that other developers will rely on to understand and debug their work. That’s incredibly motivating.


## What I’d Tell My Past Self
If I could go back to my Outreachy application days, I’d say: don’t be intimidated by browser internals. You don’t need to understand everything all at once. Stay curious, ask questions, and build momentum one piece at a time.
Also, don’t underestimate the value of your current skill set—being a backend developer helped me understand the importance of network behavior. Now, I’m just seeing the other side of the coin.

🙌 Final Thoughts
Working on Servo has opened up a whole new world of browser development for me. I now see browsers not just as tools, but as complex, elegant systems full of moving parts—and I get to contribute to one of them.
To any future Outreachy applicants reading this: your perspective matters, and your learning curve is valid. Keep showing up, keep asking questions, and keep building. You’re more capable than you think
